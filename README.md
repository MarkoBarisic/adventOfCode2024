This repository keeps track of all the work done for the [**Advent of code 2024**](https://adventofcode.com/2024) 🎄🎁💻

# How to run 🏃
```
cd dayX
go run dayX.go [--test] [--debug]
```
Use `--debug` to get debug output

Use `--test` to run on the test puzzle input (`dayX/inputs/test.txt`), 

by default the real puzzle input is used which should be provided at `dayX/inputs/real.txt`

## CLI app coming soon 🧑‍🏭
